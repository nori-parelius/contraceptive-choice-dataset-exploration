# contraceptive-choice-dataset-exploration
Some exploratory data analysis and machine learning predictions using the Contraceptive Method Choice Dataset from UCI.
I wanted to explore some Pandas and Seaborn functionality as well as try some machine learning algorithms. I picked the CMC dataset from UCI machine learning library, which is a subset from 1987 Indonesian survey of contraceptive use. All is in a single Jupyter Notebook with data as downloaded from UCI included here.
